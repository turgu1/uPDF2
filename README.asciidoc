uPDF (micro PDF) - Qt Creator - Version 2.0
===========================================

uPDF is a PDF Viewer specifically designed to minimize keyboard interaction requirements. It's being used by the author as a tool to display muscial scores on a dedicated Rasperry Pi and a monitor hooked to an electronic piano. A mouse is the only tool available for interaction with the device. A keyboard is supported by uPDF if available.

Main caracteristics:

- Multi-columns document display (up to 5 columns)
- Selection for the last 30 viewed documents
- Automatically open the last viewed document with last display parameters
- Fullscreen mode
- Text selection and copy to clipboard (from FlaxPDF)
- 5 different automatic view modes to optimize screen space asset (some from FlaxPDF)
- 1 customizable trim mode to set the view portion of the document
    * even/odd page trim management
    * specific page to page trimming selection
- Fast background document retrieveal through multithreading (from FlaxPDF)
- Whole document caching in memory (no delay in going from a page to other once loaded) (from FlaxPDF)
- Free and open source (Gnu General Public License V3.0)

This is a spinoff made from the excellent piece of software FlaxPDF (see http://github.com/clbr/flaxpdf). The original announcement page of FlaxPDF is available below under the <<FlaxPDF,FlaxPDF>> header below.

uPDF is being developped using Qt Creator 4.2.0, the free version. In particular, it is used on OSX, Ubuntu, Linux Mint and Rasbian platforms.

Planned development
-------------------

- Installation packages for OSX, Linux and Raspberry Pi
- Installation package for Windows
- Horizontal/Vertical Scrollbars
- Bookmarks
- Text search tool
- Preferences Pane
- Printing

Some of the new capabilities have been sent to the original author of FlaxPDF for potential integration in his own application at the time uPDF was using FLTK as the GUI framework. Since then, the decision was made to go to the Qt creator with uPDF 2.0 for further development.

Build
=====

The following packages are required and may need to be built and installed if not
available as a package:

- poppler (At least version 0.50 available as http://poppler.freedesktop.org/poppler-0.50.0.tar.xz)
- liblzo (package liblzo2-dev)

The following packages are usually available via package management under linux and are required by poppler:

- libjpeg (package libjpeg-dev)
- libpng (package libpng12-dev)
- libtiff (package libtiff5-dev)

For example with the apt-get command, they can be installed as follow:

  $ sudo apt-get install libjpeg-dev libpng12-dev libtiff5-dev liblzo2-dev

Poppler
-------

To properly build poppler, some libraries are required to be installed. That's the case for libjpeg, libpng and libtiff to manage embedded images in PDFs. Other libraries are required and are often already installed. Here is a page to get some more information about dependencies:

http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/svn/general/poppler.html

Once the popper library is untared, you need to build it with the following commands:

------------------------------------------
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr               \
              --sysconfdir=/etc           \
              --disable-static            \
              --enable-build-type=release \
              --enable-cmyk               \
              --enable-xpdf-headers
$ make
$ sudo make install
------------------------------------------

uPDF
----

To build uPDF, you will need Qt Creator V 4.2.0 under Unix or OSX. The file uPDF2.pro need to be opened with Qt Creator.
All the previously indicated libraries must have been installed before building the application.

Insallation packages for OSX, Linux and Rapsberry Pi are under development.

Here is the original announcement for the FlaxPDF application:

[[FLAXPDF]]
FlaxPDF
=======

FlaxPDF is a fast, nice multithreaded PDF viewer for the desktop.

As long as there are more pages than cores, every core will get a workout.

Light on dependencies, trimming borders, and aggressive caching are its major points. Okular and Evince are nice but heavy; and the point for starting this project, ePDFview, is dead.

EPDFview was nice and light, but lacking in a couple ways:

- no caching, if you wanted to backtrack one page, it reloaded slowly
- no automatic zoom to content/trim

Now with my main PDF viewer being dead, why not build a fresh one with those two itches scratched?

Requirements
------------

Poppler, LZO, and FLTK 1.3.

Comparison
----------

Evince 3.10.3, FlaxPDF 0.6.1 and ePDFview 0.1.8 were tested. The same document was scrolled repeatedly to check the cpu usage, the binary size was measured, as well as RAM use.

		CPU		RAM		Binary
Evince		90%		56.8 MB		507 KB (evince + libpdfdocument.so)
ePDFView	72%		46.3 MB		124 KB
FlaxPDF		57% (5% *)	36.5 MB		45 KB

* To be fair to all, these measurements were done using the Vesa driver. FlaxPDF, as the only one of the three, is able to take advantage of the GPU, dropping its CPU use when scrolling to 5% (tested on radeon).
